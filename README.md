# BRACTALRINO
New Malware Made on Visual Studio in c++! Works only on Windows 11 - 7 (Also works on 32-bit systems)

Warning! This file should be only running on virtual machine because this can destroy your PC by overwriting the MBR, meaning that it will no longer make windows boot up. And it disables regedit and task manager.

For this program to work, you have to install Visual C++ 2015-2022 redistributable x64 and x86 so that the virus can run without any problems.
